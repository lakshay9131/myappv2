# Umbrella 
 LAst Commit Brach  Umbrealla v2

## Approach
1) use of flex and grid to make 2 equal columns with a ga of 50 px apprx
2) use of css and oop to create necessary objects such as colorproperties
3) use of functional components for easy management.
## TODO
1) improve animation  and match exactly at button too*
2) improve code optimisation   if more files are there , we need to use  lazyloading or other
3)  improve color and dimensions as they are approximately matched
